Starting Execution:	[1 out of 4] scenarios in the [This Feature file demonstrates SHAFT_Engine's built in steps] feature
Scenario Name:		[TC001 - Open Browser, Navigate to Google, Search for query, Assert Result]
Scenario Steps:
Given I Open the target browser
When I Navigate to "https://www.google.com/ncr" and get redirected to "https://www.google.com/"
And I Type "SHAFT_Engine" into the element found by "name": "q"
And I Press the "Enter" key into the element found by "name": "q"
Then I Assert that the "href" attribute of the element found by "xpath": "(//h2[text()='Web result with site links']/following::a)[1]", equals "https://github.com/MohabMohie/SHAFT_ENGINE"
And I Close the current window
